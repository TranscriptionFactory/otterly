## Terminal

- Diff-first draft review with partial apply
- Edit/ask mode toggle
- Unified "AI Assistant" command palette entry

- Generic pipeline infrastructure (reusable for future CLI integrations)

## Plugin system

- Plugin discovery from `<vault>/.carbide/plugins/` via `manifest.json`
- Manifest parsing with permission validation
- Sandboxed iframe execution per plugin
- `postMessage`-based RPC bridge with permission-checked dispatcher
- RPC namespaces: vault, editor, commands, ui
- Per-plugin error tracking with auto-disable on repeated failures

- Hosted in iframe sandbox with custom URI scheme
- Bi-directional sync between app and Excalidraw instance
- Canvas naming dialog on create
- Theme-aware background
- Canvas feature slice architecture (CanvasPort, CanvasTauriAdapter, CanvasService, CanvasStore)

## Metadata & Bases

### Metadata cache

- YAML frontmatter indexed into SQLite alongside search (derived, not authoritative)
- `note_properties` table: per-note key-value pairs with type detection (string, number, boolean, date, json)
- `note_tags` table: per-note tag index
- Incremental updates on note create, modify, rename, delete
- Per-note accessors (`get_note_properties`, `get_note_tags`) for downstream consumers (graph, tasks, plugins)
- Batch query (`list_all_properties`) for property discovery

### Properties widget (Visual Frontmatter)

- Interactive key-value grid rendered as a Milkdown NodeView
- Type-aware editors: boolean toggle (Switch), number input, date picker, text input
- Pill-based tag editor with inline add/remove
- Two-way sync between Svelte widget and ProseMirror YAML state
- Graceful degradation on malformed YAML (error state with raw text fallback)
- Source mode: widget auto-destroyed, raw YAML fences shown

### Bases

- Dedicated feature slice: ports, store, service, adapter, panel, table
- Query model: property equality, contains, numeric/date comparison (gt, lt, gte, lte, neq)
- Tag filters
- Sort by properties or built-in columns (title, mtime_ms)
- Table and list view modes
- Pagination (limit + offset)
- `.base` view persistence (save/load JSON definitions)
- Auto-refresh on vault change via reactor

## macOS integration

- Registered as default app for `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx`
- File-open events routed to matching vault or prompt to add as vault
- Native Tauri command for resolving files to vaults

## Command palette & shortcuts

All features register into a centralized `COMMANDS_REGISTRY` and are accessible via the omnibar. Default hotkeys are assigned for high-frequency actions. Full action registry pattern: UI, keyboard shortcuts, command palette, and Tauri menus all dispatch through `action_registry.execute()`.
