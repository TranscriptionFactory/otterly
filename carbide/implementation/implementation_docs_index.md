# Carbide Implementation Documentation Index

This index is the implementation packet for the current Carbide roadmap. Read it as a companion to:

- `carbide/implementation/unified_ferrite_lokus_roadmap.md`
- `carbide/research/lokus_portability_reassessment.md`
- `carbide/plugin_system.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`

## How to use this packet

1. Read the unified roadmap for delivery order.
2. Read the portability reassessment before borrowing anything from Lokus.
3. Read `execution_security_and_readiness.md` before starting any new implementation workstream.
4. Read the phase-specific implementation doc for the work you are about to build.
5. Treat these docs as implementation guides, not as permanent API guarantees. Clean internal breaks are allowed if they simplify the system and preserve the documented intent.

## Recommended reading order

### Start here

1. `execution_security_and_readiness.md`
2. `phase1_terminal_and_document_performance.md`
3. `phase1_visual_customization.md`

### Then move into net-new slices

4. `phase2_graph_mvp.md`
5. `phase3_metadata_and_bases.md`
6. `phase4_tasks_and_views.md`
7. `phase5_plugin_host_implementation.md`
8. `phase6_canvas.md`

## Current implementation stance

- Badgerly remains the base.
- Lokus remains a donor.
- Ferrite remains a performance and safety donor.
- Plugins, terminal sessions, and command execution remain separate security domains.
- Markdown and vault compatibility guardrails remain in force.

## When this packet should be updated

Update this packet when any of the following change:

- the unified roadmap changes delivery order
- a new implementation doc becomes the source of truth for a workstream
- an earlier decision about Lokus donor value changes
- a phase lands and the remaining implementation plan materially changes
