Full-vault graph visualization and sqlite-vec semantic embeddings infrastructure

**A1: Full-Vault Graph View**

- Force-directed graph rendering of all vault notes using d3-force layout with SVG
- New Rust command `graph_load_vault_graph` returning flat node + edge arrays with dedicated LRU cache
- Viewport culling for efficient rendering at scale (up to 5000 nodes)
- Graph view mode toggle between neighborhood and vault-wide views in GraphStore
- New `VaultGraphCanvas` Svelte component with zoom, pan, and node interaction
- Layout domain module with force simulation state management

**B1: sqlite-vec Embeddings Infrastructure**

- Embedding inference via `fastembed` crate with `bge-small-en-v1.5` (int8 quantized, 384-dim)
- Vector storage via `sqlite-vec` extension with `vec0` virtual tables in existing per-vault SQLite DB
- Hybrid search pipeline: FTS + vector KNN + Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60) with heuristic re-ranking
- New Tauri commands: `semantic_search`, `hybrid_search`, `get_embedding_status`, `rebuild_embeddings`, `embed_sync`
- Background embedding pipeline: batch processing (50 notes/batch) with progress events and cancellation
- Graceful degradation when model or extension unavailable — FTS search continues unaffected
- Frontend ports, adapters, and types for all embedding operations
